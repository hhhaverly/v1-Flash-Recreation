# Incredibox v1 Recreation
This is a faithful recreation of the lost v1 remaster (Flash)

This took 3 days without a break, that means I couldn't work well on some mods. 

# Big thanks to...

Joalor64, who downloaded all the files from the Wayback Machine 
and modified them to look like the official 2018 site.

Seal, who made the animation renderer, This was a huge help in making this 
look like the original

If you want, you can download this project and modify it to your liking so that Flash mods don't die!
Little miss (Chrismas Variant) is on the way.

The fla's will be uploaded in a few hours...

I just forked this mod for fun. :) From hhhaverly.
